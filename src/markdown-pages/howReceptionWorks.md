## Fall 2023 Reception

At the THS International Reception, we use our own Signup System, built by our amazing IT Team, where our new students can view all of our events and be able to book them.

For the reception, you will have events divided into a couple of categories, that limit how many of them you can book and attend! We have split them according to the categories below:

* **Paid**: Students are allowed to sign up for a **maximum of 4 Paid events**.
* **Free**: Students are allowed to sign up for a **maximum of 4 Free Events.**
* **Unlimited:** Students are allowed to sign up for how many Unlimited Events they want.

Our events are popular amongst students, but please keep in mind that there **may be spots that open up suddenly**. If a student does not show up to a payment  desk after being reminded to attend it, we will remove them from our event list and open the spot up for new students. Also, students may decide to unregister for events due to other commitments.

Please keep in mind that if you cannot attend one of our events, you will be able to unregister from the event at the latest two days before the event's start date. If you suddenly cannot make the event, please contact us so that we can remove you from our system. Also, if your event requires a payment, please attend one of our Check-In Desks. There will be one on January 16th during the Arrival Day, but we will also announce some additional ones in our Facebook group.

Do not forget that the THS International Reception Spring 2023 has a wristband that you must collect and wear to attend events. If you do not have a wristband, you will not be allowed to attend an event, even if you have booked it. Wristbands can be collected at one of our Check-in Desks.
