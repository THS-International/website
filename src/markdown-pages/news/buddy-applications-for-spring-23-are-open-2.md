THS hosts the International Reception to make these newcomers feel welcome. We are looking for you to be part of this massive, exciting experience by helping out as a Buddy.\r\n\n\r\n\nAs a Buddy, you will be part of organizing events and showing the new students KTH. You will aid the Project Team in helping out during the events. You will also be assigned a group of students with a similar study field, who you will have to contact, and for whom you will organize some meetings. Apart from that, we want you to socialize, get to know the international students, and give them the warmest welcome possible during their first time in Sweden.\r\n\n\r\n\nYou will have the possibility of participating in all kinds of amazing events. There will be Gasques, Osqviks, museum tours, sports events, hiking trips, a massive concluding Banquet, and so many more!\n\nOur Buddy applications are now open!
