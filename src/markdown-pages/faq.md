          We use our own sign up system, built by our own IT team of student
          volunteers, where students can sign up for events. The link to the
          sign up system will be sent via email.
        title: How do I sign up for the events?
      - description: >-
          We are responsible for new KTH masters, exchange, and PhD students. We
          cannot accommodate more people due to space and budget. That includes
          guests of those who are eligible to participate, such as significant
          others, friends, or parents. 


          Please note, you **do not** need to be a THS member to attend our
          events. THS is our central Student Union, and we are a project group
          within the Student Union, similar to a THS association. 


          We organize these events for our new students, so as long as you are
          attending KTH and fall into one of our responsible study programs,
          then you are allowed to attend!
        title: 'Who can attend the THS International Reception? '
      - description: >-
          THS is the Student Union at KTH, which works with education quality,
          student life, and other work. More info about them can be found
          [here](https://ths.kth.se).


          The THS International Reception is a student-run project group within
          THS that organizes the welcome reception for our set of students. The
          Project Team consists of student volunteers.
        title: >-
          What is the difference between THS and the THS International

          You can find the Fall 2022 Reception rules
          [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PsjCwyyCwoPCrktIbzaEohfkA9DSdT7zka8PeFJAOzg/edit?usp=sharing).
          By using our signup system and participating in Reception events you
          automatically agree to these rules.
        title: What rules do I have to follow for the Reception?
      - description: >-
          To receive a Buddy, you will need to register to our sign up system.
          Once you have done so, we will assign you to a Buddy, who will contact
          you via the email that you have used in our sign up system. 


          Buddies are student volunteers who will be leading the Buddy Meetings,
          which is a small group of new students in similar study fields. In our
          sign up system, you will see that there are Buddy Meetings that can be
          booked in the system, but please note that this is more to serve as a
          reminder that these are the dates that we usually have the Buddy
          Meetings, depending on your arrival date.
        title: When do I get my Buddy?
      - description: >-
          We put the health and safety of our students and community first. We
          do not know exactly how this situation will impact our Reception, but
          we have alternative plans and are willing to adjust to the situation
          in accordance with the information provided by THS, KTH, and the
          Swedish Health Institute.
        title: >-

          pandemic?

  - category: Event Sign Up
    questions:
      - description: It will be soon! We are in the process of fixing some small details.
        title: 'When will the event calendar be released? '
      - description: >-
          You'll be informed via e-mail on when the booking of events opens. If
          you have not recieved an email, contact info@thsint.se and they will
          be able to help.
        title: When will I be able to sign up for events?
      - description: >-
          We recommend checking the sign up page frequently since some students
          will unregister themselves from some events. As soon as someone
          unregisters, their spot becomes open in the system. Out of experience
          the closer it comes to the event the more people change their activity
          plans, but keep in mind that you usually can only unregister yourself
          up to one day before an event. 


          You cannot join a full event, regardless of your motivation for it.
          The event limitations are in place due to restrictions in the size of
          the event location, available material (like food) and our own
          organizational capacity. If you join a full event without our explicit
          consent, we will remove you from the event. In severe cases we ban you
          from attending further events in the Reception.
        title: The event I wanted to attend is full. What can I do?
      - description: >-
          We do not have a waiting list system yet, but this is currently in the
          planning phase. Therefore, we recommend to check the sign up system
          regularly for open spots.


          Hopefully in future Receptions we will be able to have a waiting list!
        title: Can you put me on a waiting list for a specific event?
      - description: >-
          Unfortunately this is not possible. We are aware that some events are
          very popular among new students but we cannot add more events. This is
          due to limitations in funding, the amount of people helping out, fire
          safety, booking of facilities, etc... Therefore, we are not able to
          offer more events than what we have right now in our event calendar!
        title: >-
          Can you organize additional events, e.g. another gasque, hiking or
          Osqvik?
      - description: >-
          Yes! If you want to swap events or give your spot to another new
          student, please have both of you email us at info@thsint.se with the
          name of the person and the event. Please wait for confirmation from
          us. 


          This needs to be conducted at least one day before the event.

        title: What’s my Chapter?
      - description: >-
          This only applies to people who belong to the following Chapters: E &
          MiT, IN, F and K. 


          If your Chapter is not listed above, it means that your Chapter is not
          collaborating with us this Reception, and to our knowledge no events
          are offered for you. 


          Please read the entire event description before signing up, and if you
          are unsure what Chapter you belong to, you can check
          [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRBIcNbmG1vW0L47mWMuLZHwui7QHFuIz8RlkTrKtgIUh21nwcyDRdkFi56i1O2j1EvkmFlEqJ4yw0i/pubhtml).

    questions:

          Yes, but not all events. These are marked in the bottom of our event
          description as well as on our sign up page. 


          It is mandatory to check-in and collect your wristband **at least one
          day prior** to your first event at one of our Check-In Desks. Keep
          this in mind when booking your tickets. You will also be able to pay
          for your tickets that require a payment at the Check-In Desk. These
          will be announced in our Facebook Group and will be held throughout
          the Reception. You must pay for your event ticket at one of these
          Check-In Desks before attending the event.
        title: 'Do some events require payment? '
      - description: >-
          In the calendars that we have below, we have some of the prices marked
          as Price X/Price Y, showcasing the non-alcoholic/alcoholic ticket
          price. In our sign up system, all prices will be marked as the
          non-alcoholic ticket. For the events titled Gasque, Osqvik, and Sauna
          Night, we will ask you at our payment desk if you would like to pay an
          additional fee for a ticket with alcohol.
        title: What do Price X/Price Y mean in the event calendar?

          I don’t arrive on an Arrival Day. Where can I pay for my events that
          have a fee?
      - description: >-
          Yes you can, but we will need email confirmation from both the buyer
          and the seller that you would like to do a ticket swap. Please both of
          you email info@thsint.se, 24 hours before your event's start time. 


          You can post in our Facebook group to see if anyone would like to take
          your ticket. 


          Do not pay the seller until **after** you have gotten email
          confirmation from us. We check the lists to make sure that the buyer
          and the seller are both part of our student list! 


          Also the price must be the same amount as our own prices. In other
          words, you are not allowed to make profit off our tickets.

  - category: Attending the Events
    questions:
      - description: >-
          Yes, we will not accept any drop-ins. It is also mandatory to check-in
          and collect your wristband **at least one day prior** to your first
          event at one of our Check-In Desks. Without the wristband, you will
          not be allowed to attend any event.
        title: Do I have to have signed up to the event to attend?
      - description: >-
          Usually one or two days before the event you will receive an email
          from us. This one is sent to the e-mail address you used in our signup
          system. Please check your spam folder as well, sometimes it goes in
          there.


          Also make sure that you attend one of our Check-In Desks. It is
          mandatory to check-in and collect your wristband **at least one day
          prior** to your first event at one of our Check-In Desks.

          event I signed up for?
      - description: >-
          Usually one or two days before the event you will receive an email
          from us. This one is sent to the e-mail address you used in our signup
          system. Please check your spam folder as well, sometimes it goes in
          there. If you really can’t find it, contact us.

          I've signed up for an event, but I didn’t receive an e-mail about an
          event I signed up for. What do I do?
      - description: >-
          If you cannot attend an event it is important and necessary to cancel
          your booked ticket in the sign up system. This is possible up to 24
          hours before the event starts.  A refund for paid tickets is only
          possible if the cancellation is due to a confirmed or suspected 
          Covid-19 infection. In this case please inform us by sending an email
          to info@thsint.se. This will also automatically lead to an exclusion
          from Reception events for the following 7 days to ensure the health of
          everyone involved in the reception.


          In addition, ticket swaps are allowed and encouraged. For these to be
          confirmed, both parties must send an email to info@thsint.se with the
          swap request at least 48 hours prior to the event. We encourage you to
          not send money before receiving confirmation of the swap from us.

  - category: THS Membership and Student Card
    questions:
      - description: >-
          In order to become a student member of THS, you need to have an active
          course registration at KTH. If you are only admitted to a
          course/program, but not registered, then it is not sufficient. You can
          check your registrations
          [here](https://www.student.ladok.se/student/#/aktuell). You can pay
          the membership fee [here](https://ths.kth.se/login) or at
          [KårX](https://ths.kth.se/contact/student-union-office) (Student Union
          Office). You cannot sign up for membership in advance.
        title: How do I become a THS Member?
      - description: >-
          Every active student at KTH is entitled to a student card. This card
          proves that you are a student at KTH, and also gives you right to some
          discounts at different stores. The student card is often referred to
          as the Mecenat card, named after the company providing the card.


          More detailed information can be found
          [here](https://ths.kth.se/en/membership/student-card)
        title: What is the Student Card?
      - description: >-
          Please use your student id number that you have received in your
          email, together with your temporary personal number to sign in to the
          Mecenat app for your phone. You can sign up using any email and
          password you wish.


          **No email from Mecenat?**


          The reason why you have not yet received an email from Mecenat with
          your student ID number is because you do not have any contact
          information to your KTH profile. Before you add this information,
          there will be no card created for you, and they will have no way of
          sending any information to you. It usually takes a few days for KTH to
          send the updated information to Mecenat. You can check for more info
          here
          [here](https://www.kth.se/en/student/studentliv/studentlegitimation/legitimation-1.64343).
